# Cashmere

## Why
Most humans manage their cash flow. Some do it with pen, paper and a calculator, while others use a spreadsheet or complex money management software. This was made to bridge the gap in between.

## Features
There really isn't much to it, yet. You add entities: sources of cash inflow (creditors) and channels of cash outflow (debtors). You then add the amounts. Minimal engagement of grey matter.
